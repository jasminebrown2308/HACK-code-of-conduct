# WarwickHack Code of Conduct

_Updated: Feb 25, 2021_

## 1. Purpose
A primary goal of WarwickHACK is to be inclusive to the largest number of members, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our society, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in WarwickHACK to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Tech Citizenship
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open tech citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our society.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our society is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all society members:

 - Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this society.
 - Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 - Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 - Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 - Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert staff members if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 - Remember that society event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
 - Refrain from screenshotting or otherwise recording the screen during online meetings and events, unless all participants have been informed screenshots are taking place and have been given ample oppurtunity to opt out.
 
## 4. Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within the society:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 - Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
 - Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
 - Inappropriate photography or recording.
 - Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
 - Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
 - Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
 - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 - Sustained disruption of society events, including talks and presentations.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any attendee or society member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If an attendee or society member engages in unacceptable behavior WarwickTECH staff may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the event without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
